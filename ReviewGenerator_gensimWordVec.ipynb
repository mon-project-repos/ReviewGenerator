All have been great shoes with the exception of the Scram which are technically trail runners but they were just to narrow in the toe box. These are a bit stiffer than other Asics but I hope that means they will hold up. They don't have as much cushion as the Cumulus or Nimbus and I will be going back to one of those for running. These are still good shoes, I just prefer the others.Edit:  These were bothering my feet while running. I bought gel inserts and they are so much better! The original inserts have no cushioning at all. \", \"This is my 2nd pair of Asics, but NOT my favorite! I originally purchased Gel Contend 4's and fell in love with their comfort. I should've bought a 2nd pair of them but opted for a different color/style. Not as cushy comfortable as I expected they would be and they were not the same fit as my previous pair.

            "[\"I have tried all different styles of Asics for running shoes, Contend, Cumulus, Nimbus, Scram,  GT-1000, and GT-2000. All have been great shoes with the exception of the Scram which are technically trail runners but they were just to narrow in the toe box. These are a bit stiffer than other Asics but I hope that means they will hold up. They don't have as much cushion as the Cumulus or Nimbus and I will be going back to one of those for running. These are still good shoes, I just prefer the others.Edit:  These were bothering my feet while running. I bought gel inserts and they are so much better! The original inserts have no cushioning at all. \", \"This is my 2nd pair of Asics, but NOT my favorite! I originally purchased Gel Contend 4's and fell in love with their comfort. I should've bought a 2nd pair of them but opted for a different color/style. Not as cushy comfortable as I expected they would be and they were not the same fit as my previous pair. This model fits tighter than my other pair causing discomfort to my already achy feet. I am extremely disappointed in my purchase of this item :( \", \"I really like these shoes.  I have them in three colors now.  I don't know what I'll do when I can no longer get this exact shoe.  They have great heel and toe support for high impact workouts - and I do a high  impact workout everyday.  I have tried other brands but I always end up coming back to Asics.  The only reason I stray from Asics is when they drastically change the model of my favorite shoe to the point that it's not  the same shoe ( this happened with the Kayano).  Don't change this shoe too much Asics!  New color choices is all I need. \", \"It took about a week for me to get used to how these shoes fit, because they fit differently than most other Asics shoes I've tried.  But after about a week, I didn't notice a difference any more.  They're comfortable, offer good strong support, and I love the colors in these particular shoes!  It's so nice because my back and feet don't hurt any more, since these shoes are so much more supportive than what I had been wearing!I have been an Asics wearer for over 20 years now, and these shoes didn't disappoint. \", \"These are truly made to fit true to size. I am a solid womens 10.5 M. That size is rarely made in womens shoes and sneakers, unless they are very high end. These sneakers fit me perfect. I do NOT pronate inward at all therefore they are super comfy too. Asics tend to make shoes for specific pronations, so if you have some sort of a pronate issue, be sure you look into that info. I wore 2 pairs, this style  (in other colors) being worn every day for a year. Then my feet started to hurt. I'll see how well one pair being worn every day holds up! Love them. \", 'Pros: beautiful colors. Cons: Awful  shoes. OMG, my feet hurts for over a week after wearing those shoes for two days( working 12 hr shift). Horrible. The inner cushions were so flat, it felt like I was walking barefoot. Instead I went and bought a pair of NIKE running shoes. And those worked great! ', \"The Gel Flux have been the only shoe I can wear the last couple of years.  The 4 has not let me down.  I really didn't have to break them in at all...wish they came in ALL black in my size for work...doesn't Asics realize how many millions work in the service industry. \", \"Very VERY stiff. I ordered a wide and yet they are so incredibly narrow. I find myself Wondering if these are even authentic. Nothing like my previous Asics. I'm hoping if I suck it up and break them in, they will loosen up and soften up. \", 'perfect!  they fit just as expected.  I am just getting back into running after too many years off, and these are just what I needed.  Comfortable and good support.  I also use them for different types of workouts, and they are great.

            "[\"I have tried all different styles of Asics for running shoes, Contend, Cumulus, Nimbus, Scram,  GT-1000, and GT-2000. All have been great shoes with the exception of the Scram which are technically trail runners but they were just to narrow in the toe box. These are a bit stiffer than other Asics but I hope that means they will hold up. They don't have as much cushion as the Cumulus or Nimbus and I will be going back to one of those for running. These are still good shoes, I just prefer the others.Edit:  These were bothering my feet while running. I bought gel inserts and they are so much better! The original inserts have no cushioning at all. \", \"This is my 2nd pair of Asics, but NOT my favorite! I originally purchased Gel Contend 4's and fell in love with their comfort. I should've bought a 2nd pair of them but opted for a different color/style. Not as cushy comfortable as I expected they would be and they were not the same fit as my previous pair. This model fits tighter than my other pair causing discomfort to my already achy feet. I am extremely disappointed in my purchase of this item :( \", \"I really like these shoes.  I have them in three colors now.  I don't know what I'll do when I can no longer get this exact shoe.  They have great heel and toe support for high impact workouts - and I do a high  impact workout everyday.  I have tried other brands but I always end up coming back to Asics.  The only reason I stray from Asics is when they drastically change the model of my favorite shoe to the point that it's not  the same shoe ( this happened with the Kayano).  Don't change this shoe too much Asics!  New color choices is all I need. \", \"It took about a week for me to get used to how these shoes fit, because they fit differently than most other Asics shoes I've tried.  But after about a week, I didn't notice a difference any more.  They're comfortable, offer good strong support, and I love the colors in these particular shoes!  It's so nice because my back and feet don't hurt any more, since these shoes are so much more supportive than what I had been wearing!I have been an Asics wearer for over 20 years now, and these shoes didn't disappoint. \", \"These are truly made to fit true to size. I am a solid womens 10.5 M. That size is rarely made in womens shoes and sneakers, unless they are very high end. These sneakers fit me perfect. I do NOT pronate inward at all therefore they are super comfy too. Asics tend to make shoes for specific pronations, so if you have some sort of a pronate issue, be sure you look into that info. I wore 2 pairs, this style  (in other colors) being worn every day for a year. Then my feet started to hurt. I'll see how well one pair being worn every day holds up! Love them. \", 'Pros: beautiful colors. Cons: Awful  shoes. OMG, my feet hurts for over a week after wearing those shoes for two days( working 12 hr shift). Horrible. The inner cushions were so flat, it felt like I was walking barefoot. Instead I went and bought a pair of NIKE running shoes. And those worked great! ', \"The Gel Flux have been the only shoe I can wear the last couple of years.  The 4 has not let me down.  I really didn't have to break them in at all...wish they came in ALL black in my size for work...doesn't Asics realize how many millions work in the service industry. \", \"Very VERY stiff. I ordered a wide and yet they are so incredibly narrow. I find myself Wondering if these are even authentic. Nothing like my previous Asics. I'm hoping if I suck it up and break them in, they will loosen up and soften up. \", 'perfect!  they fit just as expected.  I am just getting back into running after too many years off, and these are just what I needed.  Comfortable and good support.  I also use them for different types of workouts, and they are great. ', 'I have almost flat feet and this shoe gives me great support. I am a personal trainer and group fitness instructor so I am on my feet constantly. Great shoe for the price! ', 'Great shoe for people with flat feet! Very comfortable and has great support. ', \"I had never purchased shoes without trying them on first, so I was leary in doing so, but I love Asics and took a chance. The fit is wonderful and so supportive, that's the original reason I started wearing Asics to begin with years ago. Have to mention the colors are just beautiful also!!! \", 'ASICS always impressed me. Loved the fit, and I haven’t worn sneakers this comfortable in a while. Tested out at the gym and a full day walking, I expect the same pleasure in them on my long jogs in the future!

Like the look of them though. :) \", 'Works great for me! Asics in my opinion run small so I recommend a size up. ', \"Love these shoes.

I'm really disappointed since I ordered a medium width and have never had a problem with this kind of pain wearing a sneaker before. \", 'Love these sneakers!  Great fit and lots of cushioning! ', 'I purchased these shoes years ago and of course when I needed a new pair, the store no longer carries them and the \"new\" model is $30 more...So I was thrilled to have found them on Amazon.  They arrived and look just like the ones I have to replace them with but the color is so much brighter, I get comments on them when I wear them, love the orange/pink..They fit like a glove and my Orthotics fit perfect in these shoes and in fact my foot doctor approved of these shoes .  Thanks for having my shoes available, I purchased TWO pairs. ', 'I bought these from seller CyberMinds21 for plantar fasciitis relief. These really hurt my feet when i tried them on and walked on the carpet in my house. I asked seller CyberMind21for refund but they said they did not accept \"worn shoes\"... What a rip off. You have to try them on but that does not make them \"worn\". They are still brand new with not a mark on them. Good shoes are expensive and now i have to buy another pair. Extremely disappointed! ', 'I have been wearing Asics for years and this is the first time I have tried this model... the Flux4 does seem to have a wider toe box than the other styles I have worn which is great for my wider foot. ', 'Asics have always been my favorite shoes, especially the flux series. I ordered this pair in a wide because I work 12 hr shifts and am on my feet most of it, and I do not like things really tight around my toes. Even in a wife they are so tight I cannot move my toes when I put them on, and that is even after loosening the laces as much as possible around the toe area. Otherwise they are exactly what I would expect from my favorite brand. ', 'Very uncomfortable with no padding and took over a week to get here when should have taken two days.  Definitely do not like and disagree with reviews ', \"Low on arch support. Runs a bit small. I'm a 10 to 10.5.... should have ordered the 10.5.

Highlighter bright. \", \"I loved the fit of the Gel Flux 2, but since they have been discontinued, I tried the 3 and 4.  The 4 fit better than the 3, but not as good as the 2.  I had to go up a 1/2 size in order to get the best fit.  I've been walking in them a few days now, and figure they should be good to run in. \", 'Very comfortable; nice wide toe box.  Get 1/2 size larger.  I did that based on reviews and they fit perfectly. ', 'These shoes fit better then most athletic shoes. I have narrow heels, but somewhat large at the \"balls of my feet.\" These shoes fit comfortable, yet snug. ', 'I use these shoes for exercise.  The product fit ok but one shoe seemed slightly bigger than the other even though the size is the same. ', \"These shoes are the worst running shoes I have ever owned. They are so heavy and bulky. The tow box is wide which for some people that might work but for me it doesn't because I have slightly narrower feet than the avaerage foot. Not happy that I wasted my money on these. \", 'I always buy Asics athletic shoes and wear them to run half marathons. This particular pair is not comfortable and feels a little smaller than others I have that are the same size.

They are everything I expect in a running shoe and so comfortable I don't want to take them off.  I am pronated and this shoe is made for this.  I have tried other brands but I found these the best fit for me. \", 'Once I went up a 1/2  size larger than I normally would a sneaker it was perfect.

My legs and feet hurt after wearing them. ', \"I have worn a ton of sneakers and need to take really good care of my feet. These, by far, are the best that I can find. Comfortable and stylish, they fit me to a tee. I love them. I can wear them all day and not have my feet hurt a bit. I wear them for working out, to work, out for the day, etc. I am very careful with them so they maintain their clean appearance as lighter shoes tend to look dirty quickly.
